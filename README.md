## Overview

This was challenged by frontendmentor.io, I really enjoyed building it. The most stressful and fun part was drag and drop functionality. Which I accomplished using react-dnd library.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Add new todos to the list
- Mark todos as complete
- Delete todos from the list
- Filter by all/active/complete todos
- Clear all completed todos
- Toggle light and dark mode
- **Bonus**: Drag and drop to reorder items on the list

### Screenshot

Below are the screenshots of how the app looks like on mobile and desktop both in dark and light mode.

## My process

### Built with

- Used Semantic HTML5 Markup
- Tailwind css - For styles
- Vite + React
- Mobile-first approach

### What I learned

I learnt a lot from this project. From planning to execution. I didn't know about how the drag and drop functionality worked. But thanks to this project, I got insight of that too. Furthermore, I learnt more about state management in React and its useEffect() hook.

### Continued development

I would like to learn more about drag and drop workflow and add these functionalities in my futue app.
